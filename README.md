### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jeremy. I'm a frontend developer who once thought he could become a full stack developer but then decided to focus more on the frontend (for now). My repositories here are from when I was learning and building personal projects. On my coding timeline, you'll see blank spaces where no personal code has been committed. During those times, I was either committing code to a private repository as a freelancer or witnessing the birth of my son or on a long run. 

Have a look around and get in touch!
